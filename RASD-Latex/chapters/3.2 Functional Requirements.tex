\paragraph{Registration of Companies}
\begin{itemize}[label={[\textbf{FR\arabic{reqCounter}}]}, align=left, leftmargin=*]
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} The system shall allow new companies to register on the platform using a valid email address.
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} After providing an email address, the system shall verify the provided address through a verification email.
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} After the new company user has verified their email, the system shall generate and deliver a password with a minimum length of 32 characters, including a randomized combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, for the newly created account via the verified email.
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} The system shall allow the company user to log in with the validated email address and the provided password.
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} Upon the first login, the system shall require the new user to provide a certificate from the relevant tax authority, including the company name and unique identifier. The system shall also require the full company name and unique identifier to be entered manually in the relevant input fields alongside the certificate. 
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} The system shall exclusively accept files in the .pdf format for the initial company verification document. The system shall validate the file format and ensure that the file size does not exceed 10 MB.
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} The system shall ensure that the input field accepts only string-type inputs, with all Unicode characters supported. The system shall validate the input in real-time and reject non-string data types.
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} The system shall retain company user data only at two points: first, after successful email verification, where the provided email address and generated password will be retained as login credentials; and second, after submitting the initial verification information, where all submitted data up to that point shall be retained.
    \item \stepcounter{reqCounter} The system shall provide an appropriate error message if the process is interrupted at any stage, specifying the reason for the interruption. The level of data retention will depend on the stage the user has reached before the interruption, as described in [FR12]
