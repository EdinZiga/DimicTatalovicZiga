This section aims to present what objectives the formal analysis is aimed to achieve. Firstly, formal model shall verify the consistency of platform constraints, test special cases and demonstrate relationships among entities through example worlds. \\

%Components of the model, structure and relationship that are defined in the alloy analysis are:
%\begin{itemize}
    %\item User: Abstract signature extended by Student, Company, and University.
    %\item Internship: Represents a professional opportunity with a status that controls its availability.
    %\item Application: Links a Student to an Internship, with a status (Pending, Accepted, Rejected).
    %\item Complaint: Represents an issue raised by a student, resolved by a university, targeting an internship.
    %\item Feedback: Allows students and companies to provide evaluations of internships.
%\end{itemize}

%Constraints:

%Ownership: Internships must have exactly one owning company.
%Unique CVs: Each student must have a unique CV.
%Application Rules: Students can only apply once to the same internship and cannot apply to internships in Draft or Closed states.
%Complaints: Students can only file complaints about internships they were accepted into.
%Feedback Rules: Feedback must target valid internships.
