This enables users to keep their information relevant and up-to-date. \\

\textbf{Internship Advertisement Creation and Management}
Companies can create internship advertisements by providing detailed information about the role, required skills, offered benefits, and the selection process. They can update, activate, deactivate, or delete advertisements to ensure only relevant opportunities are visible to students. \\

This data helps improve the platform and build trust between users. \\
