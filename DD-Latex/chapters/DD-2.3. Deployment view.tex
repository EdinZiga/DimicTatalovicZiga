The deployment view presented in Figure 4 depicts a simplified instance of the S\&C running on AWS, similar to the diagram in Section 2.1. This view differs in that it takes additional hardware and software elements into account, but from a logical standpoint, it remains very similar to the diagram in Figure 2. Moreover, it should be noted that this diagram highlights a single instance of the system, and does not present the possibility of multiple pods with multiple containers on multiple servers, as shown in Figure 2.
