As AWS is widely regarded as the "golden application" of the three-tier architecture, the presented component view depicts the components running on the Application Tier, or the second layerâ€”in other words, the system's back end. The Database Tier and Presentation Tier components were segregated for better clarity. While most components are self-explanatory, some possess complex responsibilities. This section clarifies their roles within the system.
