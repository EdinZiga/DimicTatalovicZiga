The S\&C platform is designed to streamline the internship process by addressing the needs of three main user groups: Companies, Students, and Universities. Each group is provided with custom functionalities to support their respective roles in the internship ecosystem. \\

The platform enables companies to efficiently create and manage internship advertisements. These advertisements include detailed descriptions of requirements, projects, and relevant terms, ensuring clarity for prospective applicants. Companies can accept internship applications from students and handle the entire selection process, supported by tools for conducting interviews and distributing structured questionnaires. While the platform is conducting all the necessary steps in order to complete the selection process, interviews are supposed to be held on the external service (Microsoft Teams, Google Meet...) Once an internship is filled, companies are encouraged to provide feedback on their experience with the platform and its functionalities. \\

Students can utilize the platform to upload their data and CVs, creating comprehensive profiles that highlight their skills and experiences. They can search for internship opportunities that align with their goals and proactively initiate the application process. The platform enables easy and smooth participation in the selection process by allowing students to respond to invitations to interviews and questionnaires. In addition, students receive timely notifications regarding their selection status and are encouraged to provide feedback on their experience. For any challenges encountered during an internship, the platform provides a mechanism for students to submit complaints. \\

Universities play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the internship process by handling complaints submitted by students. They monitor and resolve issues, ensuring that internships provide a safe and productive environment. This oversight contributes to maintaining the reputation of the platform as a trusted intermediary between students and companies. Handling of the complaints should be done between the university, student, and company directly and not through the platform.
