\quad The purpose of the Students \& Companies (S\&C) platform is to provide a centralized, user-friendly environment where university students can search for internship opportunities and where companies can advertise their offers. By consolidating internship advertisements in one place, the platform allows students to easily compare opportunities based on criteria such as required skills, offered benefits, and other terms. It ensures a safe and transparent process, minimizing the risk of exploitation by providing mechanisms for university supervision and feedback. Companies benefit from the platform’s reach, enabling them to connect with a broad pool of talented students efficiently. In addition, the platform fosters trust by ensuring university oversight, making it a reliable space for students and companies to interact.
