        the complaint or to terminate the internship. The system shall
        allow for both choices to be submitted. \par
        [FR37] The system shall not allow the termination of an internship by

        garding the internship experience. Moreover, the system shall re-
        quest feedback from all three users types involved in the internship
        regarding their satisfaction with S\&C. \par

        internship feedback. After the review, the system shall allow the
        university to either include the ratings in the profiles of both the
