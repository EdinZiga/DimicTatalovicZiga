This chapter provides a detailed explanation of how the platform described in the previous sections will be developed and tested. The primary goal of the testing process is to identify and resolve the majority of bugs present in the code written by the development team. This ensures the platform functions as intended and meets its requirements. Furthermore, section 5.3 will offer a comprehensive explanation of how the various components of the code are integrated and interact with one another to create a cohesive system. Meanwhile, section 5.2 will focus on outlining the most important strategies and methods used during the implementation phase to successfully develop the project.
